# WarehouseWreckage

Using the Unreal course from Udemy called "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" and evolve this final project by combining it with other knowledge obtained as the studies progress to show how much a simple project can evolve. This project was made solely with Blueprints and some Assets from the Marketplace in its first commit. 
I hope you can follow both my progress and that of this project. I hope to learn faster to update this code more quickly. :P
