# WarehouseWreckage

Using the Unreal course from Udemy called "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" and evolve this final project by combining it with other knowledge obtained as the studies progress to show how much a simple project can evolve. This project was made solely with Blueprints and some Assets from the Marketplace in its first commit. 
I hope you can follow both my progress and that of this project. I hope to learn faster to update this code more quickly. :P

Description: A game where the player can float on the map while throwing spheres that interact with the physics of the scene, knocking them down, generating sound from the collision of the spheres in the scene with a limit of 10 spheres.
