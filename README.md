![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c60aed6-c69e-4f81-8068-432930e80fcc)


## Project Goal
This project serves as a learning demonstration, but it's also something I plan to develop further in the future. The game's goal is to destroy the environment within a time limit and accumulate the highest score possible before the match ends, similar to old-school destruction-focused games.

## Description
The player can float around the map while throwing spheres that interact with the physics of the scene, knocking down objects and generating sound from collisions. There is a limit of 10 spheres that can be thrown at a time.

## Installation
To run and edit the project, you need to:
1. Install Unreal Engine 5, available [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```
3. Open the project in Unreal Engine.

## Technologies Used
- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprint

## Contributions
I am open to receiving feedback and suggestions to improve the project. Any contribution is welcome, as I believe that learning from the community will be essential for the project's and for my skills future development.
